# Spatial Statistical Analysis of Cell Images



How to use the code (More thorough description/explanation will follow):

1. Place all scripts in the folder in which you would like to store your results

2. Open main.py, change parameters under the section "Setup"

   (For taking a better look at all the functions used in this script, see the other .py files)

3. Run main.py  

   --> should generate a folder "Results" at the first run and then, for every run, generate a subfolder 	   named "results\_{current_date}\_#{number_of_the_run}"

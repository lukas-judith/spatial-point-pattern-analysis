# Spatial Point Pattern Analysis

This repository contains a framework for analysing the distribution of point patterns on 2D or 3D images (here assumed to be stored in the .tif file format) with a pixel-based version of Ripley's K-function. 

It was created in part of an internship project at the [Heidelberg Collaboratory for Image Processing (HCI)](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de).

*Up-to-date README with instructions for how to use the code will be included in future commit*
